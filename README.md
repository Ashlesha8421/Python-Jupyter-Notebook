# 1) Input and Output 
Like all high-level languages, Python is easy to read, takes less time to write, and is portable. This versatile programming language has two versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Wiki says: Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language. That is, Python 2 is no longer in development and all new features will be added in Python 3. Note that, keeping this in mind, the code examples in this tutorial are in Python 3. Wherever Python 2.x code is shown, it will be highlighted.
